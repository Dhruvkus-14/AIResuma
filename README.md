## üîê Authentication & Storage

- All user authentication and file storage is handled by [Puter.js](https://puter.com/docs).
- No backend server is used.
- All resume files are stored in the user‚Äôs virtual cloud via Puter.

## üß† AI Integration

- AI scoring is done using `puter.ai.ask()`.
- The AI evaluates the resume based on a smart prompt and returns structured feedback and scores.

## üìå Limitations

- Only PDF resumes supported currently
- AI model used via Puter (e.g., GPT/Claude) is not fine-tuned
- Not a real ATS ‚Äî this is a **Pre-ATS Optimizer**

## üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Motivation

I built AIResuma to help freshers and job seekers like myself get AI-powered resume feedback in a private, fast, and backend-free environment ‚Äî while learning modern tech like Zustand and serverless APIs.
